# Synopsis

The following project is the data analysis of the Bit.ly dataset. The Bit.ly dataset is the log events, recorded during the actions on a particular bitlink. These events are referred to as 'decode' events. The following files are about performing an analysis on the Bit.ly dataset, to gain some insights into the URL Shortner service and its user metrics.

## Code and Execution

The code for the Bit.ly dataset analysis is in the form of a .py file and .pynb iPython Notebook File.
The iPython notebook for the dataset analysis could be accessed at:
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/namman2/Data-Analytics-Projects/tree/master/Bitly%20Decode%20Log%20Dataset%20Analysis/

The iPython notebook file hosted at Jupyter notebooks would allow you to easily visualize the data analysis, along with the relevent lines of code.
